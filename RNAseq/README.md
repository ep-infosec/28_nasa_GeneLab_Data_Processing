# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for Illumina RNA-sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7101-F.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab processes RNAseq datasets. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
