# GeneLab Workflow Information for Estimating Host Reads in Illumina Metagenomics Seq Data

> **GeneLab has wrapped each step of the estimating host DNA in Illumina metagenomics sequencing data pipeline (MGEstHostReads) into a workflow. The table below lists (and links to) each MGEstHostReads pipeline version and the corresponding workflow subdirectory, the current MGEstHostReads pipeline/workflow implementation is indicated. The workflow subdirectory contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and MGEstHostReads version used to process specific datasets that have been released are provided with their processed data in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
